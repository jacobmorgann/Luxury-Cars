            <h2>Luxry Card Brands within the United States</h2>
            <p>If you’re in the market for a new vehicle, it can be difficult 
                to determine exactly which make and model is best for you. One 
                word you may stumble across quite often in your search is ‘luxury’, 
                but what exactly does that mean for a vehicle? Contrary to popular belief, 
                luxury vehicles can come from any brand. In order to be considered a luxury car, 
                the vehicle must have high-end features that go above and beyond the average necessities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The term luxury is used to categorize vehicles that are equipped with better performance capabilities, 
                lavish interiors and all the latest safety and technology features. In the past, certain brands such as Mercedes-Benz, 
                BMW and Audi were known as the luxury vehicles. However, nowadays there are luxury models available for the mainstream brands such as Toyota and Honda.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The online popularity of the best luxury car brands in the world is a reliable predictor of future sales and the trends that are shaping the global automobile 
                industry. Every luxury car brand on our list commands significant customer attention and drives meaningful conversations on social media. They are at the forefront 
                of what matters to affluent consumers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The global luxury car industry is a growing market, projected to reach $665 billion by 2027. While German car manufacturers dominate the top of our list with BMW, Mercedes-Benz, 
                and Audi, the United States are fast catching up with Tesla. Japan only has one brand in the top 15 with Lexus, the premium offshoot of Toyota. The rest of our ranking is filled 
                by other European brands from Sweden (Volvo), Italy (Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Maserati), the United Kingdom (Land Rover and Jaguar), and France (Bugatti).</p>
